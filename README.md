# Spring Framework Overview  

Project for better understanding how Spring works by going through minimal examples.  

### Observations

- Eclipse doesn't support Kotlin gradle build scripts, yet.
- SpringFramework core and its transitive dependencies is compatible with Java SE 8 _as recent as_ version 5.3.X. Version 6 of Spring Framework only comptabile with Java 17+.
